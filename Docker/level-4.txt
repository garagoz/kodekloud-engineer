1) Task: Resolve Dockerfile Issues
    Solution:
    1. ssh into stapp01
    2. there is a Dockerfile at location /opt/docker
    3. build it, so you can see what was the errors
    4. the error -> the path shown incorrect of certification and index.html files
    5. fix the those files path
    6. docker build .
    7. that is it all :)
